# This program is a chess game. It is a simple chess game that is played on a chess board. The board is 8x8 squares.

# white pieces start the game. ie move first.
# Pieces are the pawn, rook, knight, bishop, queen, and king.
# Pawn: can move forward 1 or 2 squares if not already moved, can be blocked by other pieces.
# The pawn can capture diagonally 1 square in forward direction.
# the pawn can eat en passant if the enemy pawn is on the adjacent square after have moved 2 squares.
# Rook: can move any number of squares in any direction, can be blocked by other pieces.
# knight can move in an L shape:
#   - 3 squares in one direction and 2 squares in an orthogonal direction
#   - 2 squares in one direction and 3 squares in an orthogonal direction
# Bishop: can move any number of squares diagonally.
# Queen: can move any number of squares in any direction. (This is the same as the bishop + the rook.)
# King: can move only 1 square in any direction, can be blocked by other pieces.
# if the king and the rook haven't already moved, the player can castle.
# The king can not move into check. So a king can't check the other king.
# if the king is in check, the player must move the king out of check.
# if the king can't move out of check, the game is over.
# if the king can't move but without being in check, the game is a pat.
# if both players can't checkmate, the game is a draw.
# if a pattern is repeated 3 times, the game is a draw.
